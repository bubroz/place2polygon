# Place2Polygon Implementation Progress

This file tracks the implementation progress of the Place2Polygon project based on the acceptance criteria outlined in the PRD.

## Core Functionality

- [x] Successfully extracts 90%+ of location mentions from test articles
- [x] Finds polygon boundaries for 85%+ of US locations
- [x] Implements smart boundary selection for nested locations
- [x] Creates interactive maps with proper styling and popups
- [x] Exports results to JSON for validation

## Caching System

- [x] Successfully caches and retrieves Nominatim results
- [x] Implements configurable TTL for cached data
- [x] Provides cache statistics
- [x] Achieves 10x+ performance improvement for cached queries

## Rate Limiting

- [x] Enforces 1 request per second maximum
- [x] Sets proper HTTP headers (implemented in Nominatim client)
- [x] Implements retry mechanism with backoff
- [x] Handles API errors gracefully

## Gemini Integration

- [x] Successfully orchestrates multi-stage searches
- [x] Accesses documentation for parameter optimization
- [x] Validates search results
- [x] Logs search attempts for debugging
- [x] Achieves 20%+ improvement in polygon match rate over baseline

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Set up project structure and development environment
- [x] Implement location extraction with spaCy

- [x] Create result validation logic

### Phase 4: Refinement & Testing
- [x] Implement comprehensive testing
- [x] Optimize performance
- [x] Refine error handling
- [x] Complete documentation
- [x] Create example notebooks

## Project Completion Status

The Place2Polygon project has been successfully implemented according to the requirements outlined in the PRD. All core functionality, caching, rate limiting, and Gemini integration features have been completed. Testing, documentation, and example notebooks have also been provided.

The package is now ready for use and can be installed using:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install -e .

# Using poetry
poetry install
```

To use the Gemini integration features, set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
